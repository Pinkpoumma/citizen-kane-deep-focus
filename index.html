      <h2>What is Deep Focus?</h2>
      <p>Deep focus is a cinematographic technique where every plane of the frame — foreground, middle ground, and background — remains in simultaneous, sharp focus. It gives the audience full visual access to the entirety of a scene, allowing for more immersive and layered storytelling.</p>

      <h2>Gregg Toland's Vision</h2>
      <p>Gregg Toland, the cinematographer of Citizen Kane, coined the term "pan-focus" to describe the effect. He wanted the viewer to feel as though they were looking at reality, unfiltered by traditional focus techniques. His collaboration with Welles was groundbreaking in that he had immense creative control over how the film looked.</p>

    <section id="examples">
      <h2>Key Scene Analysis</h2>
      <div class="scene-block">
  <h3>Childhood Contract Scene</h3>
  <p>Kane is visible in the background playing in the snow while a life-altering decision is made indoors. This deep focus shot heightens the emotional irony — while the adults debate Kane’s future, he is literally and visually distant, symbolizing how decisions are being made far from his control.</p>

      <div class="scene-block">
  <h3>Breakfast Montage</h3>
  <p>This sequence uses repeated deep focus compositions and static shots to show the deterioration of Kane’s marriage. The increasing physical and emotional distance between him and his wife is quietly revealed through clever blocking and visual framing, without needing overt dialogue.</p>

      <div class="scene-block">
  <h3>Political Rally</h3>
  <p>Kane delivers a thunderous speech in front of a massive poster of himself. The composition — with Kane in the foreground and his colossal image in the background — visually conveys his inflated ego and messianic self-image. Deep focus helps exaggerate the scale of both his power and self-delusion.</p>

    <section id="innovation">
      <h2>Technical Innovation</h2>
      <p>Toland experimented with coated lenses and Kodak Super XX film to allow smaller apertures and sharper images. He even constructed custom lighting setups that enabled focus across multiple planes.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="setdesign">
      <h2>Set Design & Cinematic Space</h2>
      <p>Traditional studio sets were reimagined with real ceilings, camera pits, and breakaway walls to accommodate extreme low angles and long focus shots. Toland helped pioneer this layout with Welles, creating a space where the audience could absorb everything.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="impact">
      <h2>Legacy in Modern Film</h2>
      <p>Directors like Kubrick, Altman, and Cuarón frequently use deep focus to empower their audience to interpret space, background actions, and subtext. Citizen Kane shifted the power of interpretation to viewers, setting a new standard for cinematography.</p>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>This project taught me how cinematography can shape the story's meaning. Toland didn’t just film scenes — he built immersive environments where story and setting were inseparable.</p>
